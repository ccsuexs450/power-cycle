Repository for Spring 2019 CS498 group project

Description:

The powercycle application relies on the dependencies located in the setup.py script.
The MANIFEST.in file describes the directory structure and non python files needed for operation.


Instructions for running the GUI on Current system:

1. Open a terminal from the Raspbian Desktop

2. Change to the program directory by inputing into the terminal
   "cd Documents/Python/power-cycle/powercycle"

3. Run the program with the below command
   "python3 GUI.py"
   wait a few seconds and the GUI will open

Installation Instructions:

The program can be installed by cloning the GIT repository located at 
https://github.com/nep67/power-cycle into a directory of your choosing.

Running setup.py after installation should install the dependencies needed for  
operation. If not all dependencies are installed follow the directions in the
terminal to install the remaining needed dependencies.

Alternatively, Running setup.py also creates a tar.gz file that when unpacked 
will install the program. Use the following command to unpack the tar file.

"tar -xvzf <tar file name>"

To run the program when installed from the git repository open a terminal from
the raspbian desktop and change to the installation directory.
1. "cd <install directory>"
2. "python3 GUI.py"
